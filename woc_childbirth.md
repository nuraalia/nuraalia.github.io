## Empathy and Racism during Childbirth: Do Medical Professionals Adequately Empathize with the Pain of Women of Color in Labor?

**Project description:** This is a proposal for a project on empathy exhibited by medical professionals towards women of color during labor. (We don’t actually carry out the project, but the proposal is quite detailed.) We plan to generate our own data by administering surveys to and conducting interviews with women who have given birth in the previous two weeks, as well as one of their “labor support” people (an individual they have chosen to be with them during labor for support), and medical professionals who work in labor and delivery. Since our aim is to conduct a comparative study of women of color and white women, we plan to include equal numbers of participants from each of these groups. Our surveys will ask women and support people to rate how responsive medical professionals were to the woman’s expressions of increased pain during labor–whether they suggested new birthing positions, whether they expressed concern and gave verbal comfort, and other ways of responding. Interviews will complement the numerical data produced by the surveys. Finally, interviews with medical support people will give the researcher a sense for what standard protocols are for addressing pain during childbirth. Our hope is that this study will be of interest to medical and nursing schools as well as hospital training programs who seek to address racial bias and prejudice in medical settings.
