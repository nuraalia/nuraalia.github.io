## Empathy and Racism during Childbirth: Do Medical Professionals Adequately Empathize with the Pain of Women of Color in Labor?

By Averine Sanduku, Brett Brandom, Nichol Flowers, and Nura Hossainzadeh

**Project description:** This proposal outlines a study designed to examine empathy exhibited by medical professionals toward women of color during labor. Although the study will not be carried out, the proposal presents a detailed research plan.

To collect this data, we propose administering surveys and conducting semi-structured interviews with three groups:

- Women who have given birth within the past two weeks,
- A “labor support person” of the postpartum mother's choosing (e.g., partner, doula, friend),
- Medical professionals working in labor and delivery units.

Since our aim is to conduct a comparative study of women of color and white women, we plan to include equal numbers of participants from each of these groups. Our surveys will ask women and support people to rate how responsive medical professionals were to the woman’s expressions of heightened pain during labor. Specific indicators of empathetic response will include: whether the medical team suggested alternative birthing positions, offered verbal reassurance or expressions of concern, or took other forms of action intended to alleviate suffering.

Interviews will complement numerical data produced by surveys. Finally, interviews with medical support people will give the researcher a sense for what standard protocols are for addressing pain during childbirth. 

Our hope is that this study will be of interest to medical and nursing schools as well as hospital training programs that seek to address racial bias and prejudice in medical settings.

### Below are sample survey and interview questions for postpartum women.
